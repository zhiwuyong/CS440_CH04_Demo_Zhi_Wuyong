I chose the MIT License. Open source license agreements make it easier for others to contribute without seeking special permission. It also protects your rights as an originator, confirming at least your contribution. It also ensures that your work is not plagiarized by others. MIT is a easy license agreement, if the author only wants to retain the copyright without any other restrictions. That is, the author must include the original license agreement in the distribution. You can use, copy and modify the software. You can use the software for free or sell it.The only restriction is that it must be accompanied by an MIT license. Commercial software can use it, it can also modify the MIT protocol code, and even sell the MIT protocol code.
